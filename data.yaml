# An array of characters. Each character takes the following form:
#
#  - name: Foo @5: Bar
#    book: 5
#    tags: lorem, ipsum@5, dolor
#    blurb: The main description text. @5: And also that.
#    imgurl: An image for the character
#    alias: Another name for the item.
#    anyPropertyName: This works. Not versionable atm.
#
# Notes on each:
#   Both "name" and "blurb" are versionable strings (see below).
#   "tags" is a list of tags, comma-separated.
#     In the example, haracter has the tags "lorem", "dolor" and,
#     from volume 5 onwards, also "ipsum".
#   "book" is a simple number defining the first book the character appears in. It can
#     be ommited and it defaults to 1.
#
# The link attribute can take:
#   A string of an url
#   An object like { url: _, title: _ }
#   An array of either strings or link objects
#
# Versionable string:
#   "This. @5: And also that. @$9: This, that and the other thing."
#     => It's "This." until volume 5, then it becomes "This. And also that."
#     => After volume 9 it becomes "This, that and the other thing."
#
#   That is to say:
#     => Use "A @5: B" to have "A" become "A B" after the given volume.
#     => Use "A @$5: B" to have "A" become "B" after the given volume.

    aboutTheMoreFold: >
      It can only take extra fields. You can't shove the main blurb here, for example.
      But as long as you make it an extra field, go ahead and put as much text as you want in here.
